                        <h5>BUS SERVICE</h5>
                        <p>The greatest risk students face is getting to and from school every day. At <b> Swotroyal</b> School, safe and comfortable bus transportation is provided to pupils who live within the attendance area of the school in which they are
                            registered, and within the Ajah area. School buses are always accompanied by a designated School teacher. </p>

                        <h5>MUSIC LESSON</h5>
                        <p>Music is an extremely important subject for all children to learn and can lead to better brain development, increases in human connection, creativity, self expression and even stress relief. Students can choose from a wide range of instruments and are encouraged through fun learning experiences. </p>

                        <p>Learning in classrooms is primarily accomplished through language. The lack of education about language and about language variation explains why at <b>Swotroyal</b> School we provide a  stimulating basic language environment that supplies students with the tools they need for further develop their spoken and written language abilities. </p>

                        <p>In the world today, education has evolved way past academic achievements alone. At <b>Swotroyal</b> Montessori School, our focus is to create the right foundation for an all-round child, identify their inborn talents and help them become versatile adults. 
                            Factually speaking, it is not sufficient enough for students to get excellent grades at school, they need to integrate extra curricular activities to create a healthy balance</p>

                        <p>At <b>Swotroyal</b> School excursions are used as a learning tool to enhance the curriculum by allowing students to better grasp and retain concepts. Excursions give exciting educational experiences deeper than the regular school environment affords. It has been proven that visits to places like zoos, 
                            nature centers, community agencies, government agencies, local business, and museums increase the chances of the learners retaining what is being taught in the classroom.</p>

                        <p>The importance of sports and games in school encompasses more than just the benefit of physical activity. Increases in self-esteem and mental alertness make school sports and games necessary for every school age child. At <b>Swotroyal</b> School students are
                            encouraged to choose from a wide range of weekly sport and games activities, Inter-house sport events.
