            <p>Dear Parents and Students,<br><br> It is with great pleasure that I welcome you to our School website. 
                As Proprietress I want to reassure you of our commitment to the school 
                and the provision of an excellent all-round education for our students in our state of the art facility.<br><br>

                In the uncertain times of the 2020-2021 school year, there are two things we know for certain:<br><br> 
                1) This year will be different than any school year in the history of our school and, <br><br> 

                2) Our families and students can still count on <b>Swotroyal Montessori School</b> as being a place of learning and support! <br><br>
                School may look different this year with online learning and, hopefully, at some point returning to an in-building hybrid model.<br> 
                Yet what will never change is our commitment to serving our students community with knowledge, compassion, and dedication. <br><br>
 
                Academic learning and growth are our bottom line, yet we also understand that educating students means being attentive 
                to the “whole child” and caring about their social and emotional well-being.

                <b>Swotroyal Montessori School</b> is a place of learning, belonging, growth, and support for students, families, and community.<br> 
                Thank you for being a part of our community and school!<br> Let us know how we can help make your experience even better. <br>
                We look forward to hearing from you! <br><br>
                Sincerely,<br> <b>Proprietress, Swotroyal Montessori School </b>
